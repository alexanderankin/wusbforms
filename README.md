This repository

contains my work in working to update the technologies the site runs on.

Jekyll Branch
-------------

this one is going to be abandoned because I want to explore an option with a more standard backend, rather than try to hack something together with actual filesystem level IO and github api stuff.

run `jekyll serve` in the directory of this repo on this branch to get it to work.
